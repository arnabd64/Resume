# Resume

To edit the resume and compile it to a `.pdf` file, you must have __TeX Live__ installed on your machine. You can find the installer for OS in the following [Link](https://tug.org/texlive/). Install TeX live with the `basic` installation setting which installs only the basic LateX packages needed to get started with LateX then run the `install_text_packages.sh` to install the extra packages needed to compile this document.

You can also get started using DevContainers on Visual Studio Code.
